I'm working as Software Engineer. I admire collaboration, problem solving and open processes.

In the past I've had the joy of working as Software Engineer coding in PHP and JavaScript mostly.
I've created this blog so I can share some articles for problems I'm having in my work and occasionally some tutorials.
