##### I'm working as Software Engineer. I admire collaboration, problem solving , open processes and those who gets things done.

In the past I've had the joy of working at some start-ups companies as Software Engineer coding in PHP and  JavaScript mostly. 
I've created this blog so I can share some articles for problems I'm having in my work and occasionally some tutorials.
